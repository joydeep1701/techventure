Vote Counting Rules
Would like to say something about administrative decisions. At present we are using votes to decide on any issue.
 But how are we going to decide which decisions to implement.
 If we choose a decision which has got about 51% votes (for e.g) then it means the rest 49% are against it. 
Hence it would be unfare for the group to take such a decision . 
So, my suggestion is that we must implement only those decisions which get 3/4 of the votes of the members .

NOW its personally my view
there should be two things to determine whether one will bethere in group or not
1>>attendance ,for which i suggested a mechanism earlier
2>>in one month each and evry student should give atlest 2 topics presentation,,,now if its not voted,,that is different,,but in that case also,,in the next day he has to deliver the speech
i think that will be enough to restrict ones dedicated participation...

Now the most important thing::
1>there are no particular group member as so.
2>we will maintain a register which will keep track of attendance and topics of presentation,,all of us would come on the respective days and sign on respective date while entering the room
3>since two days are there in a week ,after 8 sessions or one month,,the total number of signs for each candidate will be counted,,if its less than 50 percent then ,,
he will not be allowed for next one month..and after that if in the next to next month he comes dedicatedly then its fine else...he will not be there in the group anymore::so at first one month out,,then permanent out

At present , Dedication & Discipline should be the only qualities upon which the membership of a person should be decided . Any other factors could be added later on.

code of conduct:::
1>>no one will say the typical"Yeh zyada janta hai,,,hamara kya hai",there is no one who knows more or less,,,we are making this to make each other know what they dont,,
ONE WILL BE TERMINATED FROM THAT DAYS SESSION IF SOMEONE MAKES COMMENT LIKE THAT
2>>IF SOMEONE IS STAGGERING THEN HELP HIM TO DELIVER THE SPEECH AS,,WE ALSO INTEND TO IMPROVE OUR VOCABULARY AND PRESENTATION SKILLS
3>>ONLY ENGLISH
4>>IN THE TECH VENTURE ROOM ,,PROPER BODY LANGUAGE SHOULD BE MAINTAINED,,,BECAUSE PM SIR TOLD HE MAY COME ANYTIME..

1>>attendance more than 50%a month 
2>>2 presentations in 8 sessions (at least 30 mins, presentation)
3>>as for now quiz is not there,but a proper quiz will be done (concentrating on previously learnt topics,of CS) after one month
4>>only english
5>>no one will say "he knows more or less" if so then the person will be terminated for one day
6>>no humiliation to the speaker ,if so then the humiliater will be terminated for one day
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
"bhai friendship apni jagah aur discipline apni jagah,,,no one should mix it"
